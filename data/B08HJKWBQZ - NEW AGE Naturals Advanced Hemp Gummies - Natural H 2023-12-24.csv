"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2021",Mike,yes,yes,Is this real?,"I am a Registered Nurse that recently treated a post surgical knee replacement patient.  My patient swore by these.  She made me look them up on Amazon.  She was not taking her ordered narcotic pain meds because she was taking these gummies.  I’ve seen acute and chronic pain (real pain).  I’ve worked in all hospital settings.  But, never do I see CBD prescriptions.  She was very convincing.I myself have back pain from herniated discs and foot pain from flat feet.  I bought some.  I take one gummy after dinner.My pain and leg stiffness has decreased, foot pain has decreased, and I sleep through the night.  How much a difference?  I think my pain levels went from a 7 to a 3 (maybe my pain levels will continue to get even better!).  My point, immediate results after 1 gummy.  It’s been 3 days now, 1 gummy a day.  I do not know long term results but as of now they have noticeably helped me with my pain, inflammation, lower back pain, sleep, and stress.  I did a little research but with more motivation and with a open mind.  I couldnt find anything negative about cbd oil.  There are so many benefits.  So I searched tolerance and addiction.  Have to find a down side to this too good to be true situation, right?  Again, all positive.  In  fact, tolerance is not a factor due to its chemical differences with how natural cbd oil “binds” to “pain receptors” compared to the way manufactured chemically made medications bind to pain receptors.  There is no tolerance or dependence.  The only real caution is buying from a reputable company that doesn’t include “junk” or THC in their product.  They do sell cbd oil with THC and that’s beneficial too but in different medical sub acute ways.  This brand is AMERICAN MADE, no THC, made in a FDA approved facility.  So far my experience is positive, almost to the point of complete surprise. It’s early but I think we’re gonna start to see cbd prescriptions as common as we see metoprolol.  Is this real, I say to myself?  Time will tell.  As of now, yes.  Thank you for your help.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PSGDZSQ7I11R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)
"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2021",Walter Prochorenko,yes,yes,Where's the Hemp?,"According to the label, there does not appear to be any hemp at all in this product.  First of all the ""Supplement Facts"" ingredients does not mention any hemp. Also of the 7 ingredients listed 5 of the 7 show 0%.  0%% is ""nothing""  so what is one paying for?  Secondly, the 9000 in bold numbers on the label also is misleading as it does not refer to anything at all. Is this a model number?  It certainly does not explain what this is.  Thirdly $34.95 for ""candy"" is a ridiculous price.  Another part of the label does show hemp oil extract, but does not indicate any quantity.  It could be just trace amounts, or just vapor.  This appears to be a complete falsehood.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R168ULOXRMU9O7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)
"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020",Memly,yes,yes,"Effective, Delicious, USA Made Gummies That Help Me Stay Asleep At Night and Wake Up Refreshed","These are wonderful and I'm glad I found them.1. The price for two bottles is excellent2. Grown and made in the USA3. Strong and effective. I was taking two or more of a previous other brand but with these, I only need one to help me sleep through the night and wake up refreshed with zero grogginess4. Non habit forming. I take one almost everyday because I sleep great when I do. But I can take them... Or not. There are plenty of nights when I am naturally tired and don't need this. Or nights when I just forget4. Great taste and flavors. They are like delicious sour gummies. No weird aftertaste. I have to remind myself that I can only have one!5. Well packaged and lighting fast shipments from this company. I've ordered twice already and my gummies always arrive ahead of scheduleIf you are taking them to help you sleep like I am, note they take 1-2 hours to kick in. I take mine after dinner and have about a 2 hour window to wind down for bed. I shower, put my kids to bed, read or watch tv, then start to feel drowsy at just the right time.These are not like sleeping pills. They don't knock me out completely. I can power through if something comes up. I have never slept through alarms, phone calls, kids crying, emergencies, etc. I am able to wake up whenever I need to, whether I'm one hour into my sleep or 5 or more. I feel safe taking them and still be able to wake up and take care of my children. If my sleep is disturbed, I can actually fall back asleep more easily as well. This is great because I co-sleep with my 2 year old who is is constantly rolling around and kicking me in her sleep. I'll wake up, be able to check if she's ok, then I can go right back to sleep. So awesome!These do contain sugar. Each gummy is 10 calories.  I am going to try the gel capsules from this brand next, so I'm not ingesting sugars before bed.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19PTH1A862JMO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022",Skylark Poems,yes,yes,They work but.,"Contrary to what one reviewer who stated that it lists no hemp, the first ingredient is hemp oil. I can certify that they do work. But I need to take two gummies in the a.m. and two in the p.m. Each person has a different metabolism. I have been prescribed 300mg of Tylenol3 for my continuous pain. These worked well enough that I stopped taking the T3 for a few days, but the result was sharp pain at the worst time, bedtime. So these work as a top off to my T3, without them the T3 does not eliminate my pain. But without T3 these do not work for my level of pain. If what you are looking for is relaxation and nerve relief I can recommend these because they have worked for me. I gave a four star review because Of having looked in vain for a natural replacement for the T3 without success.

I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep.  I take 2 gummies and it's the best sleep.  I fall asleep easily and will sleep straight through until morning every single night.My one and only complaint is the formulation was changed recently and I don't care for it.  The original formula was more of a gummy and had good flavors.  The new formula is more like a fruit chew and has more of a chemical taste.  I really hope they change back to the original formula because it's put me in the mindset to shop around for something else.,4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R6B7W8IEX765/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)
"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021",Valencia Whitehead,yes,yes,Will Keep Using To See What Happens,"I was SO looking forward to these gummies after reading the positive reviews about better sleep, reduced pain and improved mood. On the positive side, I did not find them too tart or foul tasting at all. They tasted a bit like Sour Patch Kids (which I crave) but not as tangy, and I loved that they were so colorful.However, I dislike that there’s nothing to keep them from sticking together and clumping. Maybe I should have refrigerated them immediately. Didn’t see anything in the instructions so I’ve kept them on my desk and our air conditioner is almost always running to keep the house cool.To be fair, they state that the recommended dosage is 1-2 pieces. I’m a big, tall woman (5’ll and 245 lbs) so I took 3, the first day. I had a good night’s sleep and felt super optimistic, based on those results, so I took 3 again the following night, being careful not to exceed 4 pcs every six hours, per instructions. The results were not the same, unfortunately.As it relates to reducing discomfort, I suffer from neck, knee and back pain, neuropathy, depression and anxiety. The gummies appeared to help minimize my racing thoughts that first night and actually, I think it has helped very well with that, so I feel the product probably does “take the edge off” and provide the benefit of “mood support” as the claim suggests.My disappointment relates to the failure to address my aching and soreness.  Everything still hurts so much! I tried reducing the dosage to two, and felt I was no longer able to experience the mood benefits so I’m back to 3 pieces each night about two hours before bedtime. I’ll continue to use and will update if I experience any decreased pain!",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDWVYNDNHABFT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

My doctors have said I have an inflammation issue. I was just recently getting over covid as was my father. My uncle had told him about these and gave him some to try and he ordered so for himself and gave me some to try. I didn't initially try it for the pain but to help me sleep due to the coughing.

I dont care what I would take to knock me out my pain would still eventually wake me up and I would still have to keep moving and changing positions because of my pain. Even 2 naproxen didn't take my pain away like just 2 of these gummed did. I could not believe it but when you go from constant pain to almost none you will immediately see and feel a difference.I took 2 the next night, same results, had 1 left and wondered if 1 would still work, it did. I can't say if this will be something my body gets used to and will stop working but for now I have had the best sleep I have had in years. I would like to try it out on my hips walking because I have bad inflammation in both hips (I'm only 45 and pretty physically fit and active) if they make a difference with that I will be jumping for joy and will update on that.

The sour ones (bottles on the left and right of the photo) are a different color and have a lot more sugar on them, than the bottle on top of the box.",3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KOTr6i+sL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VD5ZHV2YOIW8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

UPS trucks aren't air-conditioned and they got so hot during transport that they melted in the bottles. They were very colorful and very solidly merged. I had to toss them.The good news is the company refunded my money and that was very decent of them.,4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R223JX9HKCWSJF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023",Lou,yes,yes,What am I ingesting?,"I wanted to echo the sentiments of another reviewer. What the heck am I ingesting? There is almost no useful information on the label. I can do math, so, 90,000 MG divided by 90 gummies in the package is 100 MG per piece. 100 MG of what exactly? It doesn't say. How does Amazon partner with a company that manufactures something that is ingested with no information on the label about what it is. ""Ingredients: Hemp oil..."" is inadequate.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34GHVIY5QFVAD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)
"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2021",Jefferson Steelflex,yes,yes,THEY USED TO BE STRONGER!!!!,"I originally purchased these gummies in January of 2021. At the time, the gummies had a very strong oil flavor and each color didn’t really have too much of a different taste. The flavor was a very potent oil sour flavor that if you ate after brushing your teeth was almost unbearable due to the sourness. HOWEVER 2 of those bad boys and by the time your close your eyes it’ll be morning. I believe while they were strong, eating them before brushing your teeth was nothing unbearable and definitely able to eat although you could taste the oil and potency. Fast forward to now after finally finishing the 2 bottles, I decided to purchase again since I was satisfied last time however I noticed the recipe changed. The gummies now each have a significant blast of flavor and do not taste very potent at all. I wouldn’t be surprised if this had 0 CBD or hemp oil in it. These now literally taste like sour gummy worms you would find at the store. I don’t know if it’s in my head but they don’t feel as strong and you need at least 4-5 to even feel like they might help you sleep although these are only inducers and it isn’t really responsible for literally making you fall asleep it just should make you sleep faster. I will say I felt less groggy in the morning and woke up with more energy but I really do miss the old formula and definitely feel like these are no where near as strong as the previous ones.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP8HESHQXV7Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023",James Braaten,yes,yes,Vivid Dreams,"I've incorporated the NEW AGE Naturals Advanced Hemp Gummies into my nightly routine, and they've been quite the experience. These gummies have a great taste, making it a treat to have before bed. After taking 3 each night, I've noticed they assist in helping me sleep and often lead to vivid dreams. However, a word of caution: consuming more than 3 can intensify the dreams to an unsettling degree.While I hoped they might help with pain relief, I didn't observe any such benefits. But for those, like me, who are primarily seeking a sleep aid with the added perk of vivid dreaming, these gummies might just be what you're looking for. Just remember to stick to 3 or fewer for the best results.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I518XZ4R1M6K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2022",Carol J. Smith,yes,yes,Not as effective as the New Age Premium Hemp Gummies for me,"I've used the New Age Premium Hemp Gummies (50 mg of hemp oil extract in each gummie) for some time and they have been wonderful for sleep and very helpful for reducing anxiety.  Recently I bought the New Age Advanced Hemp Gummies from Amazon instead of the Premium Hemp Gummies, and after using them I find them less effective for sleep and totally ineffective for reducing anxiety.  In addition, I found that the bottles of Advanced Hemp Gummies list NO information about the number of mg of hemp oil extract in each gummies, unlike the Premium Hemp Gummies, which specify that each gummie contains 50 mg of help oil extract.  That means that the Advanced gummies may contain less hemp oil than the Premium gummies do, which could account for why they are less effective for me than the Premium gummies are. Amazon shouldn't allow gummies to be sold on their web site without ensuring that the exact number of mg of hemp oil in each gummie is specified on the bottle or packaging.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH8R0WJ45WTXW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HJKWBQZ,B08HJKWBQZ,Size: 90 Count (Pack of 2)

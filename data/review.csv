"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2019","Gregory Paul McCarthyGregory Paul McCarthy","yes","yes","Relief in four (4) days...beats your ""seven days"" by almost half!","Years ago--maybe 20 or more--I used G/C and found relief. My memory is getting old, but it probably took three or so weeks for the G/C to provide comfort for my knees which were taking a hit from running. I have stopped running about three (3) Mays ago because the discomfort to the knees was something that did not respond to a 'mind over matter' practice. In December, I mentioned to my chiropractor when he asked me: How's it going? I said that my knees were bothering me in some of my yoga stances when I had to bend the knees. His respons was: ""Don't do it!"" He made that command into a mantra nearly. I just wanted to tell him: Alright, already. Short story: I looked on the internet and found your product (Flexuron) there. I was intrigued by the 'seven day' effect. Furthermore, I had heard Chris Kelham (sp) on the Terry and Joe Graedon ""Peoples' Pharmacy"" some weeks (perhaps months) back talk about homeopathic aids. I was impressed with Chris' pedagree (also from the internet). So, I succumbed to Amazon's free delivery for January customers (Yes, I ordered from Amazon for the first time in my life!) Subsequently, I have reordered. I know have three (3) Flexuron bottles. My knees are doing well--especially the right one which got most of my attention. Lastly, I was pleased that a 'sore' spot on the left side of my pelvis (which was tender when I laid on my back) was greatly reduced in 'tenderness'. I had wondered why the chiropractor could just not pop that pelvis in line and obviate the pain. Now, it seems that it was not a case of adjustment but of something else that Flexuron was able to 'attack'. Enough...thanks for the opportunity to sound off.

I decided to try flexuron and told myself this is the last product I'm spending my hard earned money on with no results. I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to go for it. I've only been taking 2 a day for 5 days and already pleased with the results.

I was amazed  Previously I had had to wear a flexible back brace in order to walk for any short length of time and have painful stiffness and a burning sensation in the abdominal muscle wall.  The only difference I had made was taking Flexuron.  Again I was amazed and very pleased.  I like that I only have to take one per day.  Other joint relief supplements are taking 2 twice per day or even more with a well advertised pain relief supplement.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","T. Light","yes","yes","Want a real world Review, here it is...","When I first heard about this stuff, I kinda passed it off. I mean, How many ads do we see for magic pills that don't work? Also, everything I read about it said good for ""Joints, Joints, Joints"".. but the only ""Joint"" I could read about from the company or reviews was about knees. My knees are relatively OK. My Right HIP however, lemme tell ya. when I hit 40 I started getting HORRIBLE leg issues where I could not even walk. I was on crutches having to kick my right leg forward to take a step. It would seemingly get better, then flair up again. Turns out it was my Hip. I got x-rays and the synovia fluid around my right hip is a wafer thin layer as compared to my seemingly1/4 thick line around my left. I was told I WILL need hip replacement in my life. But now being only 49, not recommended to get it now.So lemme tell you what I experience.  When my hip decides to be a bastard, it will be totally fine and I will just move a certain way ( which is not a consistent move by the way, its random ) and it feels like the ball in my hip has a shard on it that ""catches"" the inside of my leg causing extreme pain, and a ""locking"" sensation. I will then be pain to move or step or do anything for a while then it will just  subside for no reason.. I cannot take a step first with my right leg, if I go up a curb I cannot step up and put the weight of my body on it, I have to go left foot step first. If I find myself on a ladder, I have to step left, bring up my right to same step, step up left...etc.Anyway, I have taken Glucosamine and it ""....helped?"" I guess but not enough for me to consistently think about and take it regularly enough.SO Ultimately I decided to give this Flexuron a try.the pills have a chocolate look and taste to them to me. Smooth small to medium size and easy to swallow. I decided to take daily around 6-7pm. My result are as follows now going through 1/2 the pack ( 15 days)On third day I started feeling a difference in my hip, it just felt... better.On fourth day I was able to take steps first with my right AND actually step up onto curbs with my right leg sans any pain.by the seventh day ( how many days before you are supposed to feel better ) My hip was feeling real goodEvery day since I am much more able and strong with my hip. It still gets testy once in a while, but even that the frequency and how long the pain lasts is MUCH shorter. I am not healed, but I am CERTAINLY feeling much betterSo, I took a chance for a part of the body I could NOT get to come up in any ad or review that I saw. And I am SOOOOOO glad I did.I don't think it will get me to where I can run, or work out, or do a lot of leg stuff. but it has ABSOLUTLEY brought some quality back to my normal day to day needs.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNQ4OVO99XEVH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07DP7V13H","B07DP7V13H","Size: 30 Count (Pack of 1)"

"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2020","Randy Kepple","yes","yes","Another Wonderful Product from Purity!","Purity Products has an outstanding reputation based on quality products and honest product claims supported by their users. Reviewing this new product is tricky because you have to take into consideration underlying health issues, and it's important to say that you should consult with a medical professional to determine the root cause of your joint pain.I purchased this product during the Covid-19 pandemic. My knees have always been creaky, popping and cracking when I walk and bend down to pick up things. I've had my knees x-rayed 10 years ago and my doctor said that it's normal aging, especially given how much I used to hike in my younger days, and being a professional wedding photographer for 25 years. Lots of time spent on your knees getting the best angle for a shot, as well as hauling heavy gear, it's definitely taken a toll on my knees.During the stay in place orders, my right knee flared up really bad and it was painful and stiff. It just flared up overnight and persisted for over a week, so I decided to give these a try. In the past, I've tried joint supplement pills and also fish oil tablets. Both made me nauseous and I had mild side effects from the fish oil. I'm happy to say these pills are much smaller than I was expecting and very easy to tolerate with no side effects from the krill oil.I've almost finished my first order of pills and am happy to share that my knee pain is virtually non-existent! I'm still going to visit my doctor once things settle down again, but I've been very impressed with how well these work. It's hard to say how well these will work for everyone, but I'm a skeptic and I'm sold! I'll be ordering more in a few days and I wish they weren't so expensive, but maybe they'll come down in price once they are more established on the market.

Krill oil is suppose to be good for a lot of things and at least wouldn’t make the condition worse like steroid shots.  Steroids work by suppressing the immune system and have a lot of side effects including causing insulin resistance.Something this simple just couldn’t be more than a minor help, but IT DID WORK.  In three weeks of daily use the chronic continuous pain and acute positional pain is gone.
